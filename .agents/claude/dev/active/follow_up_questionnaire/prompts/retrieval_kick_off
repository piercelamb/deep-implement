read in @ai_services/vellum/CLAUDE.md to get a feel for how we build vellum workflows

  we are going to edit this vellum workflow @ai_services/vellum/workflows/vrm_agent_q3_fy26/gather_evidence

  Its first node: @ai_services/vellum/workflows/vrm_agent_q3_fy26/gather_evidence/nodes/retrieve_sources.py

  retrieves prospective evidence from a vector DB. Currently that vectorDB has two types of evidence which you can see defined here:
  @ai_services/vellum/support/vrm_agent_q3_fy26/gather_evidence/run.py -> `parse_vellum_search_result()`

  However, we just added a third type from our followup questionnaire work: @ai_services/shared/schema/questionnaire/schema.py ->
  `VellumFollowupResponse`

  Create a TODO list to bring gather_evidence up to date so it can parse `VellumFollowupResponse` and pass it forward into the LLM
