  we're going to set up this ingestion pipeline AND do retrieval over these new types of data. We will plan the retrieval part separately.

  However, before we start now, I want to look for opportunities for the two plans to share types.

  Look closely at @ai_services/shared/schema/evidence/schema.py and @ai_services/shared/schema/artifact/schema.py

  We have a type system to represent evidence coming from an artifact that looks roughly like this:
  Reference (source: Artifact)
      │
      └── SourcedContent (content, content_hash)  ← shared base
              │
              ├── DocExcerpt (source: Document, page_num)
              │       └── RankedDocExcerpt (scores)
              │               └── VellumDocExcerpt
              │
              └── GeneratedContent (source_refs)
                      └── RankedGeneratedContent (scores)
                              └── VellumGeneratedContent (tenant_id, metadata)  ← generic base for Vellum
                                      │
                                      └── VellumSOC2SummaryContent (track, vendor_id, source_document_external_id)
                                              ↑ Lives in soc2/schema.py, uses SOC2SummaryTracks enum


  The Q/A pairs we are ingesting are also evidence which I suppose also comes from an artifact (the follow up questionnaire). So it feels like they could
  fit into this flow?

  The dont come from a Document. They could come from a Tabular artifact. Or maybe we define a new artifact like Component (like a webapp component)

  In any case, I want you to brainstorm on the types that will be shared between ingestion and retrieval and how they fit into our evidence/artifact type
  hierarchy
