We have a product called TPRM Agentic Assessment. This product attempts to automate vendor assessments using AI. It takes an organization’s questionnaires as input and converts them into "criteria" (to-be-assessed per vendor). Then when an assessment is created, the organization uploads the vendors security documents (policies, SOC2, etc) which are indexed into a VectorDB namespace and the criteria are assessed against the documents.

The output of each criterion is "MET/NOT_MET/INCONCLUSIVE". The user can review these outputs and when they see a NOT_MET or INCONCLUSIVE, maybe they want the vendor to clarify or respond to something about it.

The VRM agent *automatically* creates a follow up questionnaire combining all NOT_MET and INCONCLUSIVE criteria for the vendor to clarify. The user has the chance to modify these criteria before the follow up is sent.

The vendor receives the questionnaire, when the vendor "submits", these follow up questionnaire values are stored in the database.

If the user DID NOT modify the automatic follow up questionnaire, we automatically re-run the assessment on *just* the follow up questionnaire criteria.

If the user DID modify the automatic follow up questionnaire, we automatically re-run the assessment on *all* of the criteria (since we can't know how their modifications impact the entire assessment).

There is no limit on the number of follow-up questionnaires a user can send to a vendor throughout the course of a security review.

The data entered into the follow-up questionnaire is supposed to be given precedence over any other data in the security review during these re-assessments.

As such, we must index the follow-up questionnaire data into the same VectorDB namespace as the vendors documents to include them during RAG.

Currently our evals for TPRM Agentic Assessment do not evaluate whether or not indexed follow-up questionnaire responses are making it into retrieved results. That is what we're going to fix.

First you will read in our existing eval CSV: @/Users/plamb/Drata/ai-services/ai_services/scripts/vellum/files/evals/gather_assess/retrieval_eval/test-case-1-jan-2026.csv

This contains a row of existing questions we run during the eval.

Next we are going to create a set of follow-up questionnaire questions and answers. These should be distinct from the existing eval but in the same security theme as those. You can provide fake-but-plausible answers to them.

Write the questions and answers to a new CSV file in @/Users/plamb/Drata/ai-services/ai_services/scripts/vellum/files/evals/gather_assess/retrieval_eval
