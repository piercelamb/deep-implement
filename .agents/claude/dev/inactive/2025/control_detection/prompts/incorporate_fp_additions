  I copied the current state of the prompt here @ai_services/scripts/experiments/control_detection/prompts/control_centric_false_positive_additions2 which
  is what i want you to edit.

  read in @.agents/claude/dev/active/control_detection/planning/false_positive_additions2/combined.md and create a TODO list to start implementing.

  Remember this: you need to seek to consolidate information in the prompts before adding information. When you go to incorporate one of these changes,
  try first to add it under the same thematic section if it already exists or consolidate it with other information. You are allowed to add net-new stuff,
  but don't default to that behavior
