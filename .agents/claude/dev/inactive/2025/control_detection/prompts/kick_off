I've set up this dir: @ai_services/scripts/experiments/control_detection/models/colmodernvbert

We are going to use colmodernvbert to create similarity scores of page images to DCF controls

Fetch the colmodernvebert page: https://huggingface.co/ModernVBERT/colmodernvbert

and tell me what I need to do/download to run this model locally. For e.g., it appears to be an adapter model, what model is it an adapter for? How do i run adapters using the huggingface transformers package?
