  Build a document that explains this to someone completely unaccustomed with this. It should: describe what problem we're trying to solve
  with the reason aggregator, describe our solution and how the mapreduce process works.

  we've got these planning documents if you need them to refresh your memory:
  @.agents/claude/dev/active/control_detection/planning/map_reduce/plan.md
  @.agents/claude/dev/active/control_detection/planning/map_reduce/universal_rare/plan.md

   The document should display the `aggregate_reasons` and `consolidate_patterns` prompts in full:

  @ai_services/scripts/experiments/control_detection/reason_aggregator/prompts/aggregate_reasons
  @ai_services/scripts/experiments/control_detection/reason_aggregator/prompts/consolidate_patterns

  Summarize the results of running the reason aggregator, the logs are here:
  @.agents/claude/dev/active/control_detection/planning/map_reduce/all_polices_logs

   Paste in the results from `unversal_patterns.md` and `rare_patterns.md`:

  @ai_services/scripts/experiments/control_detection/files/experiments/template_policies/aggregated_patterns/universal_patterns.md
  @ai_services/scripts/experiments/control_detection/files/experiments/template_policies/aggregated_patterns/rare_patterns.md

  complete the document with your analysis of the results:
  @.agents/claude/dev/active/control_detection/planning/map_reduce/opus_analysis

  We will use this document to get others perspectives that have no context on what we're doing

  Write the document to @.agents/claude/dev/active/control_detection/planning/map_reduce/results_too_generic
