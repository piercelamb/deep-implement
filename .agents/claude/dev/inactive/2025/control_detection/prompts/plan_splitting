  You task is to split this plan into sequential, isolated units of work. Later, we will iterate the splits you create and create tasks
  within each split in a later prompt. The idea is to break this plan into smaller units of work so we can more easily implement and verify
  each split you create.

  Write your splitting plan to @.agents/claude/dev/active/control_detection/planning/three_stage_mapping
