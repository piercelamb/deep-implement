  your task is to create a document that describes this experiment up to now. You need to:

  - Describe the problem we're trying to solve
  - Describe the retrieval approach with colmodernvebert and how we found the score threshold (you can check out
  @.agents/claude/dev/active/control_detection/planning/research/low_vbert_threshold/colmodernvbert_score_normalization.md for more)
    - You can also learn about flipping to CONTROL_COVERAGE here:
  @.agents/claude/dev/active/control_detection/planning/docs/scoring_direction_change.md
  - Describe the approach with LLMs taking the retrieved controls and selecting mappings (you can learn more from
  @.agents/claude/dev/active/control_detection/planning/llm_control_detection/llm_control_detection.md)
  - Make sure to fully include the prompt: @ai_services/scripts/experiments/control_detection/prompts/select_control
  - then include the results from experiment 1: @.agents/claude/dev/active/control_detection/results/experiment_1 (score threshold 0.48,
  top_k = 50)
  - and experiment 2: @.agents/claude/dev/active/control_detection/results/experiment_2 (score threshold 0.48, top_k = 100)
  - what you can learn about the systems performance from the two tests
