⏺ Looking at these outputs, here's my honest assessment:

  What's Working Well

  1. Genuine abstraction achieved
  The patterns are truly meta-level "reasons why policies map to controls" - not policy-specific details. They capture the reasoning taxonomy you were after.

  2. Good coverage gradient
  - Pattern 1: 36/37 policies (near-universal)
  - Pattern 8: 13/37 policies (common but not ubiquitous)
  - Rare patterns: 1-2 policies (true edge cases)

  3. Provenance preserved
  Each pattern traces back to source policies, so you can validate the consolidation made sense.

  4. Impressive reduction
  195 → 13 patterns (93% reduction) without losing the core taxonomy of evidence types and mapping patterns.

  Concerns

  1. Potentially too abstract for discrimination

  Patterns 1-3 are so universal they're almost tautological:
  - "Policy defines scope" (36/37 policies)
  - "Policy uses imperative language" (35/37 policies)
  - "Policy has procedures" (35/37 policies)

  These describe what policies are, not why they map to specific controls. Almost every policy-control pair would match these.

  2. The rare patterns might be more valuable

  Ironically, the "rare" patterns could be more discriminative:
  - "External Interaction and Reporting" → probably maps to incident/notification controls
  - "Independent Verification" → probably maps to audit/validation controls
  - "Qualitative Attribute Mandate" → probably maps to transparency controls

  These are specific enough to actually predict which controls a policy maps to.

  3. Missing the "why this control" signal

  The patterns answer "what makes a policy compliant?" but less so "how do you map policies to security controls?"

  Verdict

  Solid first pass, but the universal patterns may be too generic to be useful for prediction. They're correct but not discriminative.
