⏺ Analysis

  Overall Assessment: The extra data is extremely valuable.

  What the additional fields provide:

  | Field                 | Value Added                                                                              |
  |-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Control Triggers      | Gives auditors specific keywords to scan for in control text - makes the rule actionable |
  | Policy Cues           | Tells auditors exactly what to look for in policy documents                              |
  | Failure Mode          | Critical for avoiding false positives - "what would make this mapping WRONG"             |
  | Insufficient Evidence | Prevents weak/spurious matches - "what looks like evidence but isn't"                    |
  | Decision Effect       | Classification for downstream logic (all are supports_mapping currently)                 |

  Quality observations:

  Strengths:
  - The failure modes are genuinely useful. E.g., Rule 7 (Frequency/Timing): "Timing is indefinite (e.g., 'periodically' without definition)" - that's a real auditor pitfall
  - Insufficient evidence sections capture nuance: Rule 1 distinguishes mandatory statements from "keywords appearing in guidance, background, or non-mandatory sections"
  - Control triggers are concrete enough to use programmatically (could feed these into a retrieval/search system)

  Concerns:
  1. All rules are supports_mapping - no weak_support or blocks_mapping rules emerged. The prompts may need tuning to elicit negative/blocking patterns
  2. Some triggers are meta/circular - Rule 1's control triggers are control keywords, specific terminology - not as concrete as Rule 9's prohibited, unauthorized, forbidden
  3. Rare rules with 2 sources (Rules 2, 6, 8) are borderline universal - the threshold for "rare" vs "universal" may need adjustment

  Bottom line:

  The extra fields transform these from abstract pattern descriptions into something an auditor (or an LLM auditor) could actually execute. The failure_mode and insufficient_evidence fields are particularly high-value for preventing false positives. Worth keeping.
