⏺ ChatGPT raises several excellent points. Let me analyze:

  My Assessment

  1. Internal Inconsistencies - CRITICAL BUG, will fix

  ChatGPT caught that I didn't fully align the plan:
  - Overview still says "diverse"
  - Method name still _create_diverse_batches()
  - Architecture diagram says "diverse"
  - Success criteria says "controls from different clusters" (diverse logic)

  2. Candidate Budgeting - AGREE, will add

  Valid point: if threshold yields 400 candidates and max_calls=50, what happens? Need explicit budget rule.

  3. Exact Quotes Causing False Negatives - PARTIAL AGREE

  Valid concern about OCR errors, paraphrasing. For v1, I'll add:
  - Text extraction to help LLM quote accurately
  - Validation logging (not hard failure)

  4. Clustering Specification - AGREE, will add

  Need to specify: mean-pooled token embeddings, determinism (seed), versioning metadata.

  5. Retrieval Anchors - GREAT IDEA, will add

  Include "top_pages: [12, 13, 14] (highest similarity)" in prompt. We already have this data!

  6. Binding Language Clarification - AGREE

  "Declaratives only count if presented as requirements, not descriptions"
