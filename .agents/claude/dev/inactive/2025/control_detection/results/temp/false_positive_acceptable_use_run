Documents evaluated: 1

Retrieval Stage (before LLM):
  Embedding recall: 100.0% (7/7 GT controls pass threshold)
  Sent to LLM:      100.0% (7/7 GT controls in LLM batches)

Counts:
  Ground truth controls: 7
  Predicted controls:    80
  True positives:        6
  False positives:       74
  False negatives:       1

Micro-averaged (pooled across all docs):
  Precision: 7.5%
  Recall:    85.7%
  F1:        13.8%

Macro-averaged (mean of per-doc metrics):
  Precision: 7.5%
  Recall:    85.7%
  F1:        13.8%

Time to First MAPPED:
  Documents with MAPPED: 1/1
  Mean:   23.11s
  Median: 23.11s
  Min:    23.11s
  Max:    23.11s
