  The LLM rarely used "other" (1.3% combined), and when it did, the custom labels are quite scattered—no strong patterns emerge that would suggest adding new enum values. The existing categories seem to cover the vast majority of cases well.

  -------

  ⏺ Analysis of "Other" Category Usage

  Based on reviewing all 28 instances where the LLM used "other" (23 evidence_type, 5 mapping_pattern), here's my assessment:

  ---
  Evidence Types Analysis

  Cluster 1: Artifact/Documentation References (7 instances)
  - mandatory_documentation_list, documentation_inventory, template_requirement, document_template, documentation_standard

  These all capture the same pattern: "Policy lists required documents, templates, or artifacts."

  Example generalized_reason: "The inclusion of a specific document in a list of mandatory records or artifacts demonstrates a policy-level requirement for that control's output."

  Assessment: This IS distinct from existing categories:
  - Not explicit_mandate (that's about "must do X", not "artifact Y must exist")
  - Not procedural_definition (that's HOW to do something, not WHAT artifacts exist)

  Recommendation: ✅ Add artifact_reference - When policy references required documents, templates, checklists, or record inventories

  ---
  Cluster 2: Governance Structure References (3 instances)
  - governance_mechanism, governance_statement, definitional_framework

  These capture: "Policy references governance bodies, committees, or formal definitions."

  Example: "The policy references specific governance bodies or meeting structures responsible for the high-level review and approval."

  Assessment: Could be covered by existing categories:
  - responsibility_assignment covers WHO is responsible
  - scope_definition covers WHAT applies

  Recommendation: ❌ Don't add - Can be handled by existing categories with minor interpretation

  ---
  Cluster 3: Policy Self-Identification (5 instances)
  - document_title, policy_purpose_statement, policy_identification, document_classification, purpose_statement

  These capture: "The policy's title or purpose section identifies it as the required type of document."

  Example: "The title of the document mirrors the name of the required control."

  Assessment: This is a weak evidence type - it's essentially "the policy exists." The mapping is better captured by direct_terminology_match pattern.

  Recommendation: ❌ Don't add - This is more about the mapping pattern than evidence type

  ---
  Cluster 4: Trigger/Conditional Specifications (3 instances)
  - procedural_trigger, event_driven_mandate, implementation_constraint

  These capture: "Policy defines triggers/conditions that initiate actions."

  Example: "The policy defines the triggers and conditions under which the mandated processes are to be activated."

  Assessment: Overlaps significantly with:
  - frequency_timing (WHEN/HOW OFTEN)
  - procedural_definition (HOW things work)

  Recommendation: ❌ Don't add - frequency_timing can be stretched to cover trigger conditions

  ---
  Remaining One-offs (5 instances)
  - regulatory_alignment → covered by standard_reference
  - capability_assessment → covered by procedural_definition
  - response_protocol → covered by procedural_definition
  - monitoring_specification → covered by procedural_definition
  - configuration_governance → covered by technical_specification

  Mapping Patterns Analysis

  | Custom Pattern              | Assessment                                                                           | Recommendation     |
  |-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
  | negative_constraint         | Genuinely distinct - "Policy prohibits X" supporting a control through inverse logic | ✅ Consider adding |
  | conditional_requirement     | Overlaps with implementation_detail                                                  | ❌ Don't add       |
  | impact_assessment_alignment | Covered by process_alignment                                                         | ❌ Don't add       |
  | administrative_oversight    | Covered by process_alignment                                                         | ❌ Don't add       |
  | communication_alignment     | Covered by process_alignment                                                         | ❌ Don't add       |

  Final Recommendations

  Add to Evidence Types:

  - artifact_reference: Policy lists or references required documents, templates,
    checklists, records, or inventories that formalize the control's outputs

  Rationale: 7 of 23 "other" evidence types (30%) fell into this cluster. It represents a distinct pattern: "WHAT artifacts must exist" vs. "WHAT must be done" (mandate) or "HOW to do it" (procedure). This could be valuable for the mapreduce distillation since "control maps via artifact reference" is a different teaching point than "control maps via explicit mandate."

  Optionally Add to Mapping Patterns:

  - negative_constraint: Policy prohibits or restricts activity that the control
    is designed to prevent or detect (inverse logic mapping)

  Rationale: Only 1 occurrence, but it's a genuinely distinct logical relationship. Could be useful for teaching the LLM that "prohibition of X" can indicate mapping to controls about "preventing X." However, given the low frequency, this may not be worth the added complexity.

  What I Would NOT Add:

  The other "other" usages are either:
  1. Sub-types of existing categories that the LLM was being overly specific about
  2. Niche edge cases that don't represent generalizable patterns
  3. Weak evidence types (like document titles) that are better captured by mapping patterns

  The 1.1% "other" usage rate suggests the current categories are quite comprehensive. The main gap is artifact_reference.
