Acceptable Use Policy,DCF-32,Security Policies,"Company policies are accessible to all employees and, as applicable, third parties such as contractors. Personnel are required to acknowledge the information security policy and other topic-specific policies based on their job duties during onboarding and annually thereafter. ",LLM_WRONG,high,"The policy explicitly requires employees, contractors, and third parties to agree and sign terms complying with acceptable use, which maps to the control's onboarding acknowledgment requirement.

AI Governance Policy,DCF-804,AI Training,The Organization has established training and education programs for responsible AI practices and system management to help personnel understand their obligations and responsibilities to comply with The Organization's AI-related policies and procedures. Personnel are required to complete the training during onboarding and annually thereafter.,LLM_WRONG,high,"The policy explicitly mandates AI-related training and ongoing education for all personnel, which addresses the core intent of the control. While the policy uses the term ""ongoing"" rather than strictly specifying ""onboarding and annually,"" this is a valid policy-level mandate, and specific scheduling details typically belong in procedures or standards.","[COMPANY NAME] will provide AI-related training and ongoing education to all its personnel. At a minimum, training will address: ...

AI Governance Policy,DCF-803,AI System Opt-Out,The Organization has mechanisms in place to allow individuals or groups to opt out of or contest problematic AI system outcomes.,LLM_WRONG,high,"The policy addresses the requirement to 'contest' outcomes by explicitly referencing the handling and analysis of 'end user appeal requests' and system 'override decisions.' Since the control requires mechanisms to opt out OR contest outcomes, the explicit mandate regarding appeals satisfies the core requirement (or constitutes a valid partial match), making the Ground Truth label accurate.",Type and rate of end user appeal requests and results will be categorized and analyzed.,,Page 4,PARTIAL,PARTIAL,"While the policy establishes a mandate for handling user appeals (contesting outcomes), it does not explicitly require a mechanism for individuals or groups to opt out of AI systems."
Asset Management Policy,DCF-923,List of New Assets,"The Organization maintains a list of new assets and facilities. Management formally authorizes the use of all new assets prior to their operation, and the authorization is updated periodically. Documentation of management authorization is retained.",LLM_WRONG,high,"The policy specifically addresses the control's requirements by mandating an inventory of all assets (the list) and requiring formal approval for the creation and use of virtual assets (authorization prior to operation). The previous evaluation missed the specific mandate regarding VM authorization, which constitutes a valid partial mapping sufficient to retain the ground truth label.","Formal change management process and approval is followed for creating, storing, and using VM images.",,Page 4,NO_MATCH,NO_MATCH,"While the policy mandates asset inventory and ownership assignment, it does not explicitly require formal management authorization for the use of new assets prior to operation."
Asset Management Policy,DCF-149,Removable Media Device Encryption,"The Organization encrypts removable media devices, such as USB drives, digital video disks, compact disks, external or removable hard disks, etc., that contain sensitive data, to protect the confidentiality of the information during transport.",LLM_WRONG,high,"The policy contains a binding mandate on Page 1 stating that copies of information ""will be at a level consistent with the protection of the original information,"" which effectively extends the encryption requirements found elsewhere (e.g., endpoint encryption on Page 3) to removable media copies. Additionally, the specific section on Removable Media (Page 6) is introduced by the binding phrase ""the following steps will be taken,"" indicating that the listed controls—including the use of cryptographic techniques—are operational requirements, despite the use of the word ""should"" in the specific bullet.","Temporary or permanent copies of information will be at a level consistent with the protection of the original information... For the proper management of removable media, the following steps will be taken...

Asset Management Policy,DCF-821,Removable System Media Ownership,"The Organization assigns identifiable owners (e.g., individuals, organizations, or projects) to removable system media used in the organization. The Organization prohibits the use of removable system media when such devices have no identifiable owner. ",LLM_WRONG,high,"The policy explicitly mandates that an owner must be assigned to 'each asset' upon creation or transfer, and the document specifically includes 'Removable Media' within its scope (Page 6).

Asset Management Policy,DCF-267,Sensitive Data on Removable Media Encrypted,Sensitive data on removable storage media is encrypted wherever stored.,LLM_WRONG,high,"The policy explicitly addresses the control's subject matter in the 'Removable Media' section. The section is introduced by the binding preamble 'the following steps will be taken', which governs the list including the use of cryptographic techniques. While the specific bullet uses 'should', the combination of the binding preamble and the high-level mandate for asset owners to ensure assets are 'protected' (Page 2) constitutes a valid (at least PARTIAL) mapping. The previous evaluation was too strict in treating the weak verb as a complete lack of correspondence.","For the proper management of removable media, the following steps will be taken... Cryptographic techniques should be used to protect data on removable media to maintain integrity and confidentiality.",,Page 6,NO_MATCH,NO_MATCH,"The policy uses the non-binding term 'should' when discussing cryptographic protection for data on removable media, which fails the protocol requirement for a binding mandate."
Asset Management Policy,DCF-622,Access Control for Output Devices,The Organization manages the physical access control for output devices.,LLM_WRONG,high,"The policy explicitly defines ""Printers"" as physical assets in scope (Page 2) and mandates that ""Access to each asset will be restricted based on the asset’s classification"" (Page 1). This provides the binding policy-level requirement for access control over output devices. The previous evaluation was too strict in expecting the specific phrase ""physical access"" when the general mandate for access restriction on physical assets inherently covers physical access.","Page 1: Access to each asset will be restricted based on the asset’s classification.

Asset Management Policy,DCF-574,Mobile Device Management Software,"A mobile device management (MDM) is installed in company-issued devices and bring-your-own devices used for company purposes to enforce security for assets off-premise (e.g., location tracking, remote locking and wiping, threat detection, restrictions on software installation, etc.)",LLM_WRONG,high,"The policy mandates the specific security outcomes and capabilities that an MDM control is designed to enforce, including hard-disk encryption, automated OS updates, antivirus deployment, and the capability for data wipes. While the specific term ""MDM"" is absent, the policy explicitly requires the functionality and management of endpoints (laptops, mobile devices), which constitutes a valid policy-level mapping. The previous evaluation was too strict in expecting the specific implementation tool name in the policy document.","The following baseline security requirements will be implemented for protection of endpoint assets including company-issues laptops, workstations and mobile devices as applicable...

Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks are utilized where possible for system hardening guidance.,,Page 4,NO_MATCH,NO_MATCH,The asset management policy does not address network infrastructure configurations related to DNS server selection or configuration.
Asset Management Policy,DCF-885,Active Discovery Tool Deployment,The Organization has implemented and configured an active discovery tool to identify assets connected to the enterprise network; the tool is configured to run on at least a daily basis to ensure continuous asset discovery and visibility.,LLM_WRONG,high,"The policy explicitly mandates an asset inventory process that supports ""discovery"" and requires the use of automated systems (specifically naming Drata) to query infrastructure and obtain detailed records. It further states that records are ""kept up to date through automation,"" which semantically maps to the control's requirement for continuous/daily active discovery tools.","An asset inventory process must be in place to support... the discovery, management and replacement/ disposal of all assets...

Breach Notification Policy,DCF-193,Breach Notification,The Organization information security policies should be augmented by a statement concerning support for and commitment to achieving compliance with applicable PII protection legislation and the contractual terms agreed between the public cloud PII processor and its clients (cloud service customers).,LLM_WRONG,high,"The control requires a policy statement regarding commitment to compliance with PII legislation and contractual terms. The provided policy explicitly commits to complying with HIPAA (legislation protecting PHI, a form of PII) and mentions fulfilling contractual duties with vendors/business associates. While the policy is specific to healthcare (HIPAA) rather than generic PII or cloud processing, this represents a valid PARTIAL mapping (scope specificity), which warrants keeping the Ground Truth label.","Additionally, all third parties, subcontractors, or vendors that provide services to [COMPANY NAME] that involve the creation, receipt, maintenance, or transmission of private health information on behalf of the Employer to fulfill its contractual duties, must comply fully with HIPAA’s requirements.",,Page 2,PARTIAL,PARTIAL,The policy establishes commitment to HIPAA (PII legislation) but lacks specific mandates regarding cloud processor contractual terms required by the control.
Business Continuity Plan,DCF-602,Role-Based Contingency Training,The Organization provides up-to-date contingency training on specified intervals to users based on the users' roles and responsibilities.,LLM_WRONG,high,"The policy addresses the control by asserting that specific response teams (roles) ""have been developed and trained to respond to a contingency event.""

Change Management Policy,DCF-76,Critical Change Management,Emergency changes or hot fixes implemented outside of the standard change management process are reviewed and approved by an authorized individual after implementation. ,LLM_WRONG,high,"The policy specifically addresses 'Emergency Changes' and mandates an 'expedited process' for critical vulnerabilities (Page 3). Furthermore, the policy's general introduction requires 'proper approval is in place' for 'any change' (Page 1). While the policy does not explicitly state the approval happens 'after' implementation, the provision of an expedited process for emergencies combined with the general approval mandate creates a sufficient policy-level mapping. The specific timing (post-implementation) is a procedural detail.","In the case of Emergency Changes (e.g., when a critical vulnerability is discovered and needs to be resolved immediately), an expedited process may be conducted... The objective of this process is to manage the introduction of any change... ensuring that... proper approval is in place.",,"Page 1, Page 3",NO_MATCH,NO_MATCH,"While the policy allows for an expedited process for emergency changes due to vulnerabilities, it does not mandate that these changes be reviewed or approved after implementation as required by the control."
Change Management Policy,DCF-983,Windows PowerShell Disabled,"The Organization has disabled or removed older versions of Powershell 2.0 that are no longer supported by Microsoft (e.g., version 2.0 for Windows 10 and 11).",LLM_WRONG,high,"The policy contains an explicit mandate to remove or disable all unnecessary utility programs.

Change Management Policy,DCF-941,Immutable Infrastructure,The Organization uses immutable infrastructure with strictly defined functionality and privileges by default.,LLM_WRONG,medium,"The policy maps to the control partially but sufficiently to retain the label. It explicitly addresses the 'strictly defined functionality and privileges' requirement by mandating the removal of development code/compilers and restricting utility programs.

Change Management Policy,DCF-967,Application Control (Basic),"The Organization ensures that application control is implemented on workstations, and applied to user profiles and temporary folders used by operating systems, web browsers and email clients.",LLM_WRONG,high,"The policy mandates that 'Company operational systems will only hold approved executable code,' which aligns with the core requirement of application control (whitelisting). While the specific terms 'workstations' and 'temporary folders' are not used, the policy scope explicitly includes 'computing hardware' and 'operating systems,' making this a valid policy-level mandate.

Code of Conduct,DCF-105,Personnel Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA),"Personnel, including employees and contractors, are required to sign an agreement that outlines confidentiality requirements (e.g., non-disclosure agreements) prior to hire.",LLM_WRONG,high,"The policy effectively maps to the control by mandating that new employees sign an acknowledgment of the Code of Conduct, which explicitly includes confidentiality obligations (Page 3, 'Preserve Confidentiality'), upon starting employment. While the policy says 'when they start' rather than 'prior to hire' and focuses on employees for the signature requirement, it addresses the core intent of ensuring personnel are bound by confidentiality agreements, making the Ground Truth label valid.","New employees will sign an acknowledgment when they start with the company. ... Basically, your annual acknowledgment confirms that: You’ve reviewed the Code of Conduct and you are required to comply with the Code of Conduct",,Page 6,PARTIAL,PARTIAL,"The policy mandates signing an acknowledgment that covers confidentiality duties at the start of employment, but it does not specify signing prior to hire nor does it extend the signing mandate to contractors."
