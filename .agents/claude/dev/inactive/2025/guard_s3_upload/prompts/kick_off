  Keep the changes you made getting ExecutionSource into the temporal workflow. You uncovered something i missed while reviewing how this
  worked.

read in @ai_services/temporal_workers/workflows/vellum/create_vellum_document_workflow_v1.py

  - in a temporal activity, @ai_services/temporal_workers/activities/aws/download_file_and_upload_to_s3_activity.py, we download the presigned-url bits
  - immediately upload them to our S3 bucket
  - In a later activity, @ai_services/temporal_workers/activities/vellum/create_vellum_document_activity.py we re-download them from our s3 bucket in order to upload them to vellum

  What we need to be doing is:
  - downloading the bits from the pre-signed URL
  - uploading those bits to our s3 bucket
  - uploading those same bits to vellum

  When it works this way we can appropriately guard the s3 upload portion

  I want you to plan this change, but I want you to be very careful, e.g.

  - With this change, how should the activities be organized? What should be in an activity and what should be in a temporal workflow?
  - Can the upload to s3 and upload to vellum happen in parallel? Is there something bad about doing it in parallel?

  Write out a plan to @.agents/claude/dev/active/guard_s3_upload/planning
