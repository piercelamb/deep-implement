⏺ This is the streaming response format for Claude's Messages API (via AWS Bedrock in this case, based on msg_bdrk_).

  When you make a streaming request, the response comes back as a series of Server-Sent Events (SSE) rather than a single complete response. The content_block_delta events are streaming the tool use JSON input character by character.

  Here's the breakdown:

  | Event Type          | Purpose                                                             |
  |---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | message_start       | Initiates the message, includes token counts                        |
  | content_block_start | Starts a content block (here: tool_use for parse_question_evidence) |
  | content_block_delta | Streams partial content incrementally                               |
  | content_block_stop  | Ends the content block                                              |
  | message_delta       | Final message metadata (stop_reason: "tool_use")                    |
  | message_stop        | Message complete, includes latency metrics                          |

  If you concatenate all the partial_json values from the deltas:

  {"vendor_compliance_classification": "NOT_MET", "classification_explanation": "The evidence explicitly states that no security incidents occurred during the audit period of January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024, which falls within the last 36 months from the current date. Multiple references in the SOC 2 Type 2 report confirm that management stated no security incidents occurred during this period, and the auditor found no exceptions to this statement.", "relevant_excerpts_indexes": ["1","2","3","5"]}

  This streaming format lets clients show real-time typing/progress. If you're not using streaming features, you can either:
  1. Use non-streaming requests (stream=False)
  2. Accumulate the deltas and parse the final JSON when you get content_block_stop
