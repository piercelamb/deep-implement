Know who has access to shared vaults. Review the users in each shared vault to avoid
inadvertently sharing data with individuals who should not have the data. Keep personal accounts private. For 1Password Teams customers, store personal data like home
banking and personal email passwords in a vault that isn't part of the team. Use strong, unique passwords everywhere. Using repetitive passwords and password reuse can
create risk in the event that a single instance of the password is compromised. Use Watchtower to find passwords that need to be changed. Watchtower informs users about
accounts they have at sites that have been revealed publicly to have been breached. Administrators should:
Add at least one additional administrator. Administrators cannot recover their own accounts, so it is important to have someone else who can help if they get locked out. Attention should also be paid to ensuring administrator access to accounts is selective and judicious. Limit access to vaults. An unlimited number of vaults can be created, so additional vaults can be
used to ensure division of information. Limit permissions within vaults. When available, take appropriate safeguards using custom vault
permissions to ensure unnecessary access is not granted to users. 55

Turn on Travel Mode when crossing borders. Define which vaults are “Safe” for travel, and
enable and disable Travel Mode as users’ cross borders or are in other risky situations. Verify recovery requests. If an email account is compromised, an illegitimate recovery request could give the attacker access to their account. Out of band verification can help prevent unauthorized access. Make sure to remove people who don't belong. Suspend or delete accounts that are no longer
needed, for example when an employee departs. MANAGEMENT RESPONSES TO EXCEPTIONS
Management’s response to the exceptions identified:
The exceptions noted were a result of continued growth of the Company. During this period of growth, communication regarding specific internal processes was not distributed and enforced properly, resulting in said controls not being completed thoroughly and effectively during the examination period. These items related to the exceptions are being reworked to ensure procedures are fulfilled and controls can have adequate evidence provided. CC1.4.2, CC1.5.1, and CC5.3.4 – annual employee evaluations – processes will be implemented to ensure all annual employee evaluations fulfill requirements according to internal policy, including manager and employee signatures, by Q4 of 2022. These policies will be used during the 2022 annual evaluation. CC2.2.2 and CC5.3.3 – Security Manual acknowledgement – automated processes for the annual acknowledgement of the Security Manual by all staff will be implemented in Q4 of 2022. These processes will be used for the 2022 annual Security Manual acknowledgement. CC3.1.2, CC3.2.1, CC3.3.1, CC3.4.1, CC4.1.1, CC4.2.1, CC5.1.2, CC7.5.2, CC8.1.8, and CC9.1.2 – risk assessment – our risk assessment process and policy has been reworked to include additional factors, and ensure testing is completed within each year. The new process will be implemented Q1 of 2023. These processes will be used for the 2023 risk assessment. We believe our adjustments to these controls will be effective in meeting both the spirit and letter of these controls, and we do not anticipate further exceptions in the future due to our improvements. 56

Keep their Master Password a secret. Master Passwords should be known only to the individual end user. If the Master Password is known or disclosed to anyone else, including administrative or management staff, it should be changed immediately. Use a generated Master Password. Most human-created passwords are easy to guess. During setup, 1Password provides the option to locally and securely generate a memorable Master Password that is generally more secure than user-created Master Passwords. Generate, and store the Emergency Kit safely. Generate an Emergency Kit and store a copy of the Emergency Kit on a USB flash drive or print a copy and store it in a vault at home or safe deposit box — somewhere not online or accessible at work. The Emergency Kit contains at least the Secret Key of the specific user and should be controlled accordingly. Store all passwords in 1Password vaults. Data stored in other places is not afforded the same
protection. Sticky notes, whiteboards, and notebooks are not safe places. Only sign in from trusted devices. Public computers are not as trustworthy as personal devices and workstations. Users should be sure to only sign in to their accounts from trusted computers. Do not email or message passwords. These are easily intercepted and read by others.

These procedures are executed by qualified and experienced Directors, the Development Team, the IT Team, and the Security Team. Procedures are in place in the following areas:
Security Policy Administration: The Security Manual and related policies are reviewed at least annually by the Directors and the Security Team. The Security Manual consists of the following areas: data security, personnel security, data classification, incident response, password management, and network security. Risk Assessment: At least annually the Directors, Development, and IT Teams collaborate on
an overall risk assessment for the Company and the System. Communication: The Company opportunistically and continually uses a mixture of cultural messaging, intranet services, an internal knowledgebase, email, and in-person meeting opportunities for the communication of security policies and procedures. Regular confirmation of this communication is captured in annual attestations from each team member that they have read general internal policies. Logical Access: Team members must have unique credentials as well as established information assets. Access to systems and authorization to access the Company’s information is restricted based on the responsibilities of the individual and their role. Change Management: The Company has a SDLC Policy. The policy covers the planning, assignment, development, design, code review, impact considerations, infrastructure assignments, quality assurance, security testing, implementation, and maintenance of both the System software and infrastructure. System Change Management
The change management process has been established to provide a layer of protection for the Company by ensuring that every change performed is thoroughly discussed and is approved prior to migration to production. Changes to System configuration and infrastructure are managed as code through the same SDLC used to develop and deliver the System software. This process requires that a ticket must be filed for change requests, which then must be approved by a member of management. If approved, the infrastructure change will progress through the SDLC from approval to design and development, testing and review, and production release. Source control records are kept of the infrastructure orchestration code through this process. Availability
System availability is maintained at a high level using multi-datacenter database and application server redundancy and load balancing.

Thereafter, development activities include providing more challenging assignments, job rotation, training programs, seminars, and continuing education programs such as “bootcamps,” classes, and similar, run internally and by external organizations. Additionally, team members are reviewed regularly by their direct managers to monitor, develop, and provide counsel regarding competence, expertise, skill, and career advancement options. RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS
AgileBits has a cross-functional risk assessment process that utilizes management and staff expertise to identify risks that could affect AgileBits’ ability to meet its obligations to its customers. Risk assessment efforts include analyses of technical and non-technical threats, probabilities of occurrence, potential business impacts, and associated mitigation plans. Internal controls, policy, procedure, and peer review form the basis of risk mitigation, along with response based on severity, and team collaboration such as emergency bridges and code reviews. Exceptions or deferments are
21

to be documented and must be approved by management of the group which originates or monitors the control in question. Team leaders are required to identify significant risks related to their areas of responsibility and implement measures to mitigate those risks. Management meets regularly to identify risks and develop corrective steps to minimize the impact of these risks. The Company employs numerous methods to assess and manage risk, including documentation, policies, procedures, team structure, recurring meetings, and automated error detection controls. AgileBits strives to identify and prevent risks at an early stage through developing policy and procedure that conform to cultural and operational reality, maximizing the likelihood of compliance. Team members are instructed by general policy to relate suspected or confirmed risks to the Security Team for analysis, and mitigation as appropriate. Staff are instructed that when in doubt, a matter should be reported. CONTROL ACTIVITIES
Control activities are the actions established by policies and procedures to help ensure that management directives to mitigate risks to the achievement of objectives are executed. Control activities are performed at all levels of the organization and at various stages within business processes, and over the technology environment. Trust Services Categories, Criteria, Related Controls, and Test of Controls
The security and availability categories and applicable trust services criteria were used to evaluate the suitability of design and operating effectiveness of controls stated in the description. Criteria and controls designed, implemented, and operated to meet them ensure that the System:
Security – is protected against unauthorized access (both physical and logical). • Availability – is available for operation and use. The Company’s trust services criteria and related control activities are included in Section 4 of this report to eliminate the redundancy that would result from listing them here in Section 3 and repeating them in Section 4. Although the trust services criteria and related control activities are included in Section 4, they are, nevertheless, an integral part of AgileBits’ description of controls. For specific criterion, which was deemed not relevant to the system, see Section 4 for related explanation.

1. Deeply understand the SOC2 excerpts, paying special attention to sections containing management responses, corrective actions, or remediation plans.

2. Find all management responses to exceptions. These typically appear as:
   - **Management Response sections**: Dedicated sections labeled "Management's Response", "Management Response", or "Company Response"
   - **Action plans**: Descriptions of corrective actions, remediation plans, or mitigation strategies
   - **Status updates**: Information about implementation status or completion dates for corrective actions
   - **Root cause analysis**: Management's explanation of why the exception occurred
   - **Section 5 "Other Information"**: Unaudited section containing general management responses without specific criterion IDs

3. Look for these indicators of management responses:
   - Phrases like "Management's response", "Management has implemented", "The Company plans to", "Corrective action taken"
   - Future-tense commitments: "will implement", "plans to address", "intends to remediate"
   - Past-tense corrections: "has implemented", "completed", "remediated"
   - Specific action items: process changes, policy updates, training initiatives, system enhancements

4. Management responses may or may not have an associated Common Criteria ID (CCX.X format):
   - If embedded in auditor test tables, the CC ID may appear in table headers (e.g., "CC2.3", "CC3.1")
   - If in Section 5 (Other Information) or narrative text, there may be no explicit CC ID - set to null in these cases
   - If multiple responses exist for the same CC ID, extract them as separate entries

5. Extract the full response text as it appears in the document, preserving key details like:
   - Specific actions being taken
   - Timeline or completion dates mentioned
   - Responsible parties if mentioned
   - Implementation status

6. For each management response, attempt to identify the page number(s) where it was found by examining the excerpt text itself.
   - Page numbers may appear within the chunk text (e.g., "Page 15", "p. 18", headers/footers)
   - Use format: single page "15", range "15-17", or multiple "15, 18"
   - It's acceptable for page numbers to be null if not found - don't make them up

7. ALWAYS call parse_soc2_management_responses - this is REQUIRED even when no management responses are found. Include page numbers where available.

8. If no management responses are found, call the tool with empty `management_responses` and `relevant_excerpt_indices` arrays.
